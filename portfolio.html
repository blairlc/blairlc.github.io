            <p>Carrier is a side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring 2D physics, a camera that follows the player, and an inventory system. The protagonist is a a carrier pigeon who isn't very good at flying, so he has to deliver letters while collecting coins to take the bus home. The game was created in under 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2018. I did the programming using Unity. The art was created by Nat DeMenthon. </p>

            <p>This paper argues for the use of interactive and immersive technologies within art museums as part of a strategy to increase engagement with young people and non-traditional museum audiences. It contains case studies of ArtLens, Wonderkamers, and Meet Vincent Van Gogh. I wrote this paper as my semester-long project for the art history class Art and the Museum World.</p>
