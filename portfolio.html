        <p>Reinventing Reality is a travelling exhibit that teaches visitors about the concepts and technologies that make virtual reality work. It has several VR activities as well as an interactive video  wall, an eye-tracking game, and a spatialized audio game. </p>
        
        <p>I started on this project as an intern. I programmed several prototypes and took observations during visitor testing. Later in the project, as the producer, I coordinated the software development, UI design, and creation of custom electronics. I also hired and supervised several freelance artists and voice actors. During the first installation, I travelled to the venue to install equipment and train the museum staff.</p>

	<p> Reinventing Reality won the 2021 Gold MUSE Award from the American Alliance of Museums in the AR, VR, and Mixed Reality category.</p>

        <p>This exhibit teaches visitors about the industry around the Chesapeake Bay. It has projections, listening stations, a virtual reality 360 video player, and a multi-player touchscreen game.</p> 
        
        <p>As the multimedia manager, I supervised the software development and UI design. I also worked on the installation, technical documentation, and support.</p>

        <p>This exhibit uses video, an interactive timeline, and visitor-submitted content to teach visitors about the meaning and history of the American flag. The exhibit also has a photobooth and a mobile app.</p>
        
        <p>As the multimedia manager, I supervised the software development and UI design. I also coordinated between our team, the client, and the content producers by hosting meetings, distributing notes, and keeping tracking of deadlines.</p>

        <p>This project added eight interactive graphics to an existing exhibit. I programmed an Arduino-based system that uses touch sensors and addressable LED strands. When a visitor touches one of marked areas, it triggers a sequence of lights that illuminate hidden images in the graphic.</p>
