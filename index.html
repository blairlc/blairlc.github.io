                <h1>Leadership</h1>
                <p>I am the president and founder of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Terps-for-Disability-Justice-272188959951496/">Terps for Disability Justice</a>, a University of Maryland student organization founded over the summer of 2017. Our goals are to advocate for programs and policies that help disabled students, educate the campus community about disability, and combat ableism and exclusion. As the president of this group, I have also served as an undergraduate representative on the university Presdient's Commission on Disability Issues.</p>

                <p>I am the head of the New Membership Committee at <a target="_blank" href="http://chum.coop/">Cooperative Housing at University of Maryland</a> (CHUM). CHUM provides low cost housing to College Park residents through cooperative living. We live together, share communal meals and groceries, garden and compost, have parties, and make decisions democratically. The New Membership Committee handles the member application and placement process. As the head of the committee, I set meeting agendas, coordinate with other committees, and give updates at general body meetings.</p>

                <p>I was a mentor of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robtics Competition</a> team 2537, the <a target="_blank" href="https://team2537.com/">Space RAIDers</a>, from December 2013 through May 2017. I helped high school students with projects such as an Android app for scouting out the other teams, a team website, newsletters, and approaching companies about sponsorship. During the 2016-17 school year, I was the head operations mentor. I led a team of three other mentors and seven students who were collectively responsible for the team's marketing, fundraising, teambuilding, and award submissions. I was also the alumni coordinator for several years, which involved running the alumni Facebook group, organizing alumni meetups, and setting guidelines for young alumni who came to visit the team over school breaks. I loved mentoring but I left to focus on my last few semesters of college and starting Terps for Disability Justice.</p>

                <p>In 2015, I was the Vice President and webmaster of <a target="_blank" href="http://terpwushu.org/">TerpWushu</a>, a Chinese martial arts club at the University of Maryland. I updated the website, ran registration, and uploaded videos for two tournaments, each of which had over 100 competitors. I also ran the Facebook page, helped organize two team trips, recruited members to work at fundraisers and perform at community events, managed conflict, and got CPR certified.</p>
