            <p>Carrier is a side-scrolling 2D platformer featuring 2D physics, a camera that follows the player, and an inventory system. The protagonist is a a carrier pigeon who isn't very good at flying, so he has to deliver letters while collecting coins to take the bus home. The game was created in under 48 hours during Global Game Jam 2018. I did the programming using Unity. The art was created by Nat DeMenthon. </p>

            <p>Skills: Academic Research, Writing, Audience Analysis</p>
            <p>This paper argues for the use of interactive and immersive technologies within art museums as part of a strategy to increase engagement with young people and non-traditional museum audiences. It contains case studies of ArtLens, Wonderkamers, and Meet Vincent Van Gogh. I wrote this paper as my semester-long project for the art history class Art and the Museum World.</p>

            <p> Indira River Adventure is a concept for an interactive family water ride. It was designed for the 2018 Theme Park Design Competition. I entered with three teammates: Chris Heiner, Evan-Zane Green, and Ryan Wilson. I researched similar experiences, selected interactive technologies, created the technology budget, and wrote several of the slides in our pitch. I also recruited my teammates and organized meetings. The track layout, ride system, and construction budget was done by Chris and Ryan. The art was done by Evan-Zane.</p>
